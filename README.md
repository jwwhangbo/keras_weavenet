This repository is a keras compatible training code for weavenet, heavily inspired from [deepchem](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem). The code here is based on their proprietary epoch algorithm(which doesn't work at the moment) so I decided to write the model for keras.

The model is from the paper "Molecular Graph Convolutions: Moving Beyond Fingerprints" from google available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00856)

In short, the model takes two inputs; atom features and pair features. The fundamental operations rely on atom-to-atom, atom-to-pair, pair-to-atom, and pair-to-pair convolutions. These are illustrated in the figures below, taken from the paper.
